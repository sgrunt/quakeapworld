# Quake

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page](../player-options) contains the options needed to configure your game session.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Guns, keycards, and level unlocks have been randomized. Typically, you will end up playing different levels out of order to find your keys and level unlocks and eventually complete your game.

Maps can be selected on a level select screen. You can exit a level at any time by visiting the hub station at the beginning of each level. The state of each level is saved and restored upon re-entering the level.

## What is the goal?

The goal is to complete every level in the episodes you have chosen to play.

## What is a "check" in Quake?

Guns, keycards, and powerups have been replaced with Archipelago checks. The exit at the end of each level is also a check.

## What "items" can you unlock in Quake?

Keycards and level unlocks are your main progression items. Gun unlocks and some upgrades are your useful items. Temporary powerups, ammo, healing, and armor are filler items.
